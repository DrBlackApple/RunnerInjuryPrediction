# RunnerInjuryPrediction
This is a small project about predicting an injury of runners using a small neural network classifier. It based on this dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners.
All the neural network code is home made. It only use numpy for the backend computings. \

The main purpose was to use the SGD algorithm as the main optimization one.

## Organization

The library code is in the `libnn` directory.
